# AllYourBase
Detects misusage and overwrites of vanilla bases

## Why?

Overwriting (abstract) bases was all the rage back in A13. Some modders haven't caught on that this is now a really bad idea and causes weird and hard to detect issues. For more info: [https://spdskatr.github.io/RWModdingResources/abstracts](https://spdskatr.github.io/RWModdingResources/abstracts)

## Installation instructions:

1. Download.
2. https://rim-world.com/guides/how-to-install-mods/
3. Load order is irrelevant.

## Usage:

Load order is irrelevant. AllYourBase will spit out yellow warnings with the exact mod, XML node and file that misbehaves.

If you enable Verbose Logging, AllYourBase will attempt to fix overwrites. Sometimes this makes it worse. Use Steam's handy Verify File Integrity if that happens.

It's recommend to ~~yell at~~ educate the author of the offending mod.
